The Problem "Concurrency"
When you build a multithreaded application, your program needs to ensure that shared data 
should be protected from the possibility of multiple thread engagement with its value. 

What's going to happen if multiple threads were accessing the data at the same point? 
The CLR can suspend any thread for a while who's going to update the value or is in the 
middle of updating the value and at same time a thread comes to read that value which is not completely updated, 
that thread is reading an uncompleted/unstable data.
